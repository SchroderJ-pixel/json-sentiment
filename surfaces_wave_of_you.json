(Oh)\n\nOh, I speak loud but don't hear my voice\n\nTen feet down, does it feel like choice?\n\nHangin' onto the words you say\n\nBut \u0435very time I listen, I just h\u0435ar white noise\n\nAnd all I see are these flashing lights\n\nCan't hold, oh, they're passing by\n\nHow many wrongs does it take to right/write?\n\nHow many wrongs does it take to right/write?\n\n\n\nDaily/Baby, lately\n\nI'm spinnin' around/away, so crazy\n\nSo baby, just take me\n\n\n\nI think I'm caught in a wave, I feel 'bout you\n\nI don't know how I can be so drawn into you\n\nI think I'm fallin' in deep\n\nI think I'm caught in a wave of you, of you\n\nMm-hmm, mm-hmm, hmm\n\n\n\nDaily, lately\n\nI'm spinnin' around, so crazy\n\nSo baby, just take me (Oh, oh, oh, oh)\n\nDaily, lately\n\nI'm spinnin' around, so crazy\n\nSo baby, just take me\n\n\n\nI think I'm caught in a wave, I feel 'bout you\n\nI don't know how I can be so drawn into you\n\nI think I'm fallin' in deep\n\nI think I'm caught in a wave of you, of you\n\nMm-hmm, mm-hmm, hmm"
